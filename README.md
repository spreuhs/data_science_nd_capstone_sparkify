## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run without issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

The intent of this notebook is to predict churn for the fictional company sparkify using spark.

### Questions answered in the following:
- what information are provided in the data?
- how do we define churn?
- how many users did churn in the past?
- are activities of churned users different from still active users?
- can we accurately predict churn?

## File Descriptions

The whole process is gathered in the notebook found in this directory. Detailed description regarding the code can be found in markdown cells and comments contained in the notebook.

## Results

Most of the results can be found in the notebook. Additional information and formatted results can be found in my Medium post [here](https://spreuhs.medium.com/please-dont-stop-the-music-sparkify-cd5dd10c80b1).
